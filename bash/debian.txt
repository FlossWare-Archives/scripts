1. Decide on the name of your package. Standard debian notation is all lowercase in the following format:

    <project>_<major version>.<minor version>-<package revision>

For example, you could name your first package...

    helloworld_1.0-1


2. Create a directory to make your package in. The name should be the same as the package name.

    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1


3.  Pretend that the packaging directory is actually the root of the file system. Put the files of your program where they would be installed to on a system.

    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/usr
    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/usr/local
    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/usr/local/bin
    cp "~/Projects/Hello World/helloworld" helloworld_1.0-1/usr/local/bin


4.  Now create a special metadata file with which the package manager will install your program...

    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN
    gedit helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN/control


Put something like this in that file...

    Package: helloworld
    Version: 1.0-1
    Section: base
    Priority: optional
    Architecture: i386
    Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)
    Maintainer: Your Name <you@email.com>
    Description: Hello World
     When you need some sunshine, just run this
     small program!
     
     (the space before each line in the description is important)


5. Now you just need to make the package:

    dpkg-deb --build helloworld_1.0-1
