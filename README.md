# Scripts

Welcome to FlossWare Scripts!  This represents a collection of reusable scripts we hope you will find useful.

## History

This project got its start as a way to provide scripts for [Jenkins] (http://jenkins-ci.org) as part of our [Continuous Delivery] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) initiative.  We currently use an [OpenShift] (https://www.openshift.com) instance of [Jenkins] (https://jenkins-camponotus.rhcloud.com) and faced challenges publishing artifacts from our [Github Project] (https://github.com/FlossWare/java) to [Bintray] (https://bintray.com/flossware/maven/java/view).  We realized that we needed a repository of reusable scripts (presently bash functions) as well as provide [Jenkins] (http://jenkins-ci.org) and [OpenShift] (https://www.openshift.com) scripts that others can we reuse - ideally side stepping issues we discovered thereby helping folks to get on with "the business at hand."

## Documentation

We recently changed our documentation from our main page to the [Wiki] (https://github.com/FlossWare/scripts/wiki).  The general format of the pages is ```[script type]:  [concept]```.  For example, ```Bash:  Bintray```.

## Miscellaneous

### Plugins

While not yet written, we have a longer term goal of providing some [Jenkins plugins] (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins) for things like publishing to [Bintray] (https://bintray.com).  Stay tuned for things to come!
